When you loadup i3 you should get a basic .i3/config file to go with it 
You're going to need to edit this config file to help i3 reach it's maximum level of performance

First off,
What programs do you use?
I use quite a few, firefox,terminator,clementine,mpv,filemanager,etc...
Now that you know your programs, you'll have to figure out keys to make these programs to.
